# First Project! #
## Movie Trailer Website ##

These files are required to successfully generate the html for the movie trailer website follows:
- fresh_tomatoes.py
- media.py
- media-center.py

The python version in these files is 3.5.  To generate the html, you would need to either use terminal and type, "python media-center.py"  The rest should be operational, assuming that you have default browser (a reasonable one) enabled.

Both Anaconda Installation of Spyder and Atom with Script is able to run this program.
